# Project-2
For this subject we are required to develop a technical solution to a problem we have encountered in our  community or at CPUT or elsewhere. As a group we will decide on the problem we wish to solve and how  we wish to use ICT to address the problem.
We are required to use JAVA to develop the solution and are expected to have a working system on 
conclusion of this subject.
